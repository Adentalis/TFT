# TeamFightTactics

## Introduction

Let's try to implement an "bot" that chooses the right champions to get a perfect synergie at the end of the game

## Functionality
- Set 2 championlist (no Qiyana /Lux so far)
- class TeamAnalyser creates teams with "perfect" synergies and save them

## ToDo
- Filter for specific type of synergy or champion(s) f.ex 6 Berserker/Light ...
- implement Spartula --> create team comps where you get perfect synergy if you have a specific Spardula item
- make more realistic teams --> a team of 5 champions won't have Master Yi (5 gold unit) in it in real
- simulate a game where you can pick out of 5 champions
- read the ingame data (is this legal?) --> make a screenshot or so and "understand" the 5 champions you got ingame
- a viable Gui
- win every game :P
